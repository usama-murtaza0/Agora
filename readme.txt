Just do NPM install and run the following commands
npx react-native start(in a cmd terminal, start the terminal as an adminstrator to avoid problems)
npx react-native run-android(in another instance of the above started terminal)
the app will build and run and ask for permissions for camera and mic.
And then it will start the video call
